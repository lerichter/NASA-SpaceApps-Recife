              Graphene is the name for an atom-thick honeycomb sheet of carbon atoms. It i the building block for other
              graphitic materials. Harder than diamond yet more elastic than rubber. Graphene is the strongest known material.

              The main idea is that we can decrease the high cost of desalination using membranes with graphene. We know
              nowadays that we have some ways to desalination that cost too much. The graphene or graphene oxide, is a way to
              democratize that idea and save affected regions that have not potable water enough.

              Nasa have been tracking the water around the world. NASAâ€™s Earth Science Division studies fresh water using data
              collected in many ways, including satellites, airborne missions and even information collected by volunteers. When
              we talk about <strong>water</strong> we can talk about precipitation and how we can protect it as it cycles around
              our world.

            In 2019, scientists released a worldwide precipitation data set that compiled more than 20 years of satellite and
            other data. It is based significantly on information collected by the joint NASA and Japan Aerospace Exploration
            Agency (JAXA) project the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM) and an earlier, precursor NASA-JAXA
            satellite mission the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM).

              With the satellites we can unify our product to these water trackers. It means that we can track outdated potable
              water regions and apply the graphene membrane to preserve those regions. "Water is a precious resource on this

              The graphene membranes are more appropriate than the conventional membranes for the desalination process. The
              potencial of these membranes can overcome traditional membranes because the graphene has pontencial to overcome
              the chlorine permeability limit, selectivity and vulnerability. That's the main challenge of using the Reverse
              Osmosis Membrane and nanofiltration. This is why the Graphehe Membrane are excellent candidates as material base
              for the next generations of water purification membranes.
